            <p>
                Born in El Paso but having lived most of my childhood in Chihuahua city I am proud to be a Latinx.
                I come from a long lineage of animal breeders and Jockeys. 
                I learned to care and professionally ride a horse at the age of ten as it was a coming of age tradition. 
                I did not have cable or a personal laptops, I shared one computer with four people only to be used for homework. 
                In my free time I would build massive Lego architectures that helped me develop a strong imagination. 
                In school I never learned programming but three classes influenced me the most: CISCO routing and switching taught me how to troubleshoot, configure, and create a network from scratch;
                Computer Maintenance taught me the basic hardware and firmware of a computer and implementing said knowledge to build a custom portable computer inside a suitcase to be showcased to future classes;
                Marching band taught me that patience is a virtue when leading a large group of people to a single goal.
                I want to learn as much as I can in my life not only to progra but to also lear from other disiplines of computer science.
                This summer I am a STEP intern and I enjoy every single minute of it
